# CS2006-Python-2
# Second Python practical

In this practical we performed analysis on a twitter data set about the comet landing of November 2014. We used various python libraries to find interesting patterns in the data and to provide various visualisations.

The code/ directory contains our jupyter notebook file (no separate .py file were used) and the report/ folder contains our exported pdf of the notebook output.

## We completed:
1) All basic requirements
2) Both easy requirements
3) The medium requirement
4) The medium to hard requirement
5) One hard requirement - Implement interactive visualisiations

## Dependencies:
* Python 3
* Jupyter - pip3 install jupyter
* Pandas - pip3 install pandas
* Numpy - pip3 install numpy
* Matplotlib - pip3 install matplotlib
* Networkx - pip3 install networkx
* Wordcloud - pip3 install wordcloud
* Folium - pip3 install folium

To install of the prerequisite libraries/dependencies, navigate to the code/ directory and run the following command:
Usage: pip3 install -r req.txt
